feat: Integrate HERE Routing Pack 2A - Domain models and engine placeholder

Add engine-agnostic routing domain models and HERE-specific implementation placeholder.
This integration prepares the foundation for multi-engine routing orchestration.

Changes:
- Add routing domain models (LatLng, RouteRequest, RouteResult, RouteModel)
- Add HERE routing engine placeholder (HereRoutingEngine)
- Add HERE-specific parsers and mappers (polyline decoder, maneuver mapper, route parser)
- Add truck constraint domain model (TruckRoutingConstraints stub)

Package structure:
- com.gemnav.routing.domain: Engine-agnostic models
- com.gemnav.routing.here: HERE SDK integration layer
- com.gemnav.truck.domain: Truck-specific constraints

Technical notes:
- HereRoutingEngine.calculateRoute() returns RouteResult.Failure placeholder
- All HERE SDK integration points use `Any` type placeholders
- Domain models support future Google engine and orchestrator
- Validated via runtime testing on Android device (SM-T227U)
